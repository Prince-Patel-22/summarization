Time management involves demands relating to work, social life, family, hobbies, personal interests, and commitments. Using time effectively gives people more choices in managing activities.[1] Time management may be aided by a range of skills, tools, and techniques, especially when accomplishing specific tasks, projects, and goals complying with a due date.

Initially, the term time management encompassed only business and work activities, but eventually, the term broadened to include personal activities as well. A time management system is a designed combination of processes, tools, techniques, and methods. Time management is usually a necessity in any project management, as it determines the project completion time and scope."""
